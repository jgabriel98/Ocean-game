# Ocean-game

This is a university project, which the goal is to make a interactive program but without conventional methods of interactivity. The theme is "Sea", and i choose to use a Wii controler as input method.

The game have no goal neither a way to win. It is just yourself in a tiny boat, where you can navigate using the wii controler as an oar.

## How to use the Wii Controler/play the game:
  The controler must be hold with both hands, and by start must have the IR (infrared) sensor facing upwards, and the A button facing you.
  
  To paddle/row left, put the controler on your left ( still using both hands) and move it like you where realy rowing the boat on its left side. There is no problem in lean the controler clockWise, actually thats how it detects that you are rowing on the left side.
  
  To paddle/row left, put the controler on your right ( still using both hands) and move it like you where realy rowing the boat on its right side. There is no problem in lean the controler anti-clockwise, actually thats how it detects that you are rowing on the right side.
  
  
  
### Notes
This is a Unity project

This project is incomplete, since its aim was to implement a different way to input comands/control the game. There's a kinda empty map (sea) and you can fly off it. Also there's no sound implemented.

Feel free to colaborate to this project and use its code.
  

The game should work on Windows and MAC OS, and also on linux if you get to link the libhid library to the project (i tried it for 1 week and gave up, migrating the project to windows). It was tested on Windows 10 only.

Have fun exploring the mini sea.
